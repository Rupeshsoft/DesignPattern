Singleton Design Pattern ::
================================
1. Singleton Design pattern is going to create Single Instance of Class.
2. It is having instance initially as null which can be of type  
private static Singleton instance = null
3. Its constructor is private
4. its instance creation method is public not private.

Breaking Singleton
===================

Here , we can break with Reflection API which is imported from java.lang.reflect.Construct and can create multple objects and show its unique hashcode with object.hashCode();
